PGSNMPD Version 1.0 Release.

===== Abstract =====

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol for supervising 
the apparatus connected to the network via a network.
The version 1 of SNMP is defined by RFC1157 and the version 2 is carried
out by RFC1441. 

Network management by SNMP is realized by the UDP communication between 
a manager and the agent who resides in the apparatus for management 
permanently. An agent returns a response to the request from a manager.
when special phenomena apparatus rebooted occur, a trap is sent to a 
manager from an agent.

MIB (Management Information Base) is the database of the management 
information about the network apparatus which exists in the network 
apparatus corresponding to SNMP. The thing of each management information 
stored in MIB is called object (Object).OID (Object IDentifier),it is the
discernment child rejected in order to distinguish each object,and is also
called an object discernment child. the object is managed by the tree 
structure.

Community name is the exchange between a manager and an agent, and has a 
role like a password. That is, if the right community name is not specified 
when publishing a request from a manager to an agent, in an agent side,
it will be interpreted as unlawful access.


1.) How to Compile.

Please develop this to the contrib directory of PostgreSQL Version 8.x
And it only gmake.
However, it is necessary to have net-snmp before it.
http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/
This is checking operation by Version 5.2.1.


2.) Usage.

usage: pgsnmpd [-s] [-b] [-c FILE ] [-x address ] [-g] [-C "Connect String"]
   -s : SNMP subagent running
   -b : run in the background
   -c : configuration file name
   -g : use syslog
   -C : libpq connect strings
   -x : address:port of a network interface.
   -V : display version strings

You need to become the superuser of PostgreSQL as connection of libpq.

agent running sample.
#pgsnmpd -c `pwd`/pgsnmpd.conf -x 192.168.1.0

sub agent running sample.
#pgsnmpd -s -c `pwd`/pgsnmpd.conf -x 192.168.1.0


3.) Client Manager.

Surveillance managers, such as RMON, can be used.

for sample.
